### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am **Jacopo**


I like to keep busy by reading about software engineering and machine learning, with
a few narrative books thrown in there for good measure. I also like cooking, but that's a collateral
effect of overly enjoying food.

ðŸ‘¯Lucky enough to be writing open source software for a living at [Orchest](https://github.com/orchest/orchest). ðŸ‘¯
